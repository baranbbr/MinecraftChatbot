# Minecraft Themed Chatbot
## About
 Created in Python 3.7, this chatbot can respond to questions such as:
  >"Sven, hello." (Greetings)
  
  >"Sven thanks!" (Conversation)
 
 >"Sven, how do I craft _item_?" (Crafting questions)

 > "Sven, what can I do with _item_?" (Information questions)

You'll notice that each question begins with a prefix, "Sven", this is required so that Sven only responds to questions addressed to him and players can continue talking to each other in Discord and Minecraft without Sven getting in the way.
